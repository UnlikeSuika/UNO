# UNO
A simple UNO program for one person.

The purpose of this code is to serve as a base code from which I can implement
UNO to UnlikeBot (my Discord bot) in the future.

This version of the game primarily follows the rules outlined in the link
(http://www.wonkavator.com/uno/unorules.html), and the following rule was
added for the situations for which rules were not specifically provided:

  If the discard pile contains exactly one card and the deck does not contain
  any card, then any attempt to "draw" a card from the deck (i.e. by Draw Two
  card, by Wild Four card, or during one's own turn) will be ignored. The match
  will continue without the card(s) being drawn.
